The '''Alchemical Hydra''' is a [[boss]] version of [[hydra]], found in the lower level of the [[Karuulm Slayer Dungeon]] in [[Mount Karuulm]], requiring level 95 [[Slayer]] to kill. The Alchemical Hydra was the creation of a [[Dragonkin]] named [[Karuulm]]. While Karuulm saw promise in his creation, he nevertheless saw it as a failure because he could not replicate its traits, and abandoned it along with his other creations: the [[Wyrm]]s, [[Drake]]s, and [[Hydra]]s.

Unlike normal hydras, the Alchemical Hydra can '''only''' be killed while on a hydra [[Slayer task]], which is only assigned by [[Konar]]. In addition, as it is only found within the volcano, players who have not completed the [[elite Kourend & Kebos Diary]] must wear [[boots of stone]], [[boots of brimstone]], or [[granite boots]] to protect themselves from the extreme heat of the dungeon floor. This also applies to attempting to use the [[Item Retrieval Service]], as the rapid damage will interrupt actions and dying a second time will wipe the storage.

Along with all the unique drops obtainable from hydras, it can also drop [[hydra leather]], which is used on the [[machinery]] south-west of the pool in the [[Lithkren Vault]] to create [[ferocious gloves]], as well as the [[hydra claw]], which is combined with a [[Zamorakian hasta]] to create the [[dragon hunter lance]].

The Alchemical Hydra can be found in the lower level of the [[Karuulm Slayer Dungeon]]. Its lair is at the northern side of the dungeon, past the [[Tasakaal]] and then east past the [[hydra]]s chamber. [[Orrvor quo Maten]] will be found guarding the entrance of the lair. Alternatively, with level 88 [[Agility]] the [[mysterious pipe]] shortcut just behind [[Kaal-Ket-Jor]] may be used to reach the lair safely.

==Fight overview==
{{main|Alchemical Hydra/Strategies}}
{{Listen 
|title = [[Alchemical Attack!]]
|desc = The music which plays when fighting the Alchemical Hydra.
|filename = Alchemical Attack!.ogg
}}
The player fights the Hydra in an [[instance]]d room upon jumping over the rock barrier. The chamber consists of two rooms; an observation room which is safe from the Hydra, and a set of doors leading into the test chamber where the Hydra resides. The Hydra will become aggressive and attack upon entering the test chamber, and the doors will also lock themselves. This means that the only means of escape are to either kill the boss, die, or teleportation. Players cannot log themselves out of the test chamber either.

The Alchemical Hydra has four phases throughout the fight, depending on its remaining health. It attacks with [[Ranged]] and [[Magic]], alternating between them every three attacks for the first three phases. At the start of each phase, it has a 75% damage reduction, which can be removed if it is lured over a vent on the floor which spews chemical liquid. However, the vent must be the correct one, corresponding to the [[combat triangle]] (e.g. when it is green, red will weaken it), otherwise the Hydra's damage is increased by up to 50%.

When the Alchemical Hydra reaches or falls below 75%, 50%, and 25% of its health (that is, at 825, 550, and 275 [[Hitpoints]]), it will lose one of its heads and begin the next phase. Barring the last phase, the damage reduction is reapplied, and so it should be lured over the next vent. It also has special attacks for each phase: poison pools when green and black, electricity when blue and fire when red. These special attacks are avoidable.

In its final phase, the Hydra will alternate combat styles every attack with increased attack speed and max hit. Its first attack will always be the opposite style to what it most recently used (e.g if its last attack in phase 3 was ranged, it will start phase 4 with magic). 

When the Hydra is killed, it will respawn in approximately 25 seconds, and the doors will unlock during this time.

==Drops==
''In addition to the 100% drop, the player will also have two rolls on the Alchemical Hydra's drop table. The first drop has a chance to be a unique, while the second is always standard. The drop rates in the drop table below reflect the chance of getting an item for every roll on the standard loot table. For example, a listed drop rate of 2/100 indicates that you have two 2/100 chances of receiving that item.''{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1084600369995571203|date=13 January 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.is/jvzU5|archivedate=16 April 2019|quote=The first roll will go to the unique table OR to the standard table. The second roll will always go to the standard table. And you only get one pet roll in either situation.}}

''Due to a unique mechanic, items are slightly rarer than officially announced. The effective rates are displayed here.<ref>Whether a unique item is dropped is determined by the game rolling each item in succession, and if it fails, the next item is rolled. If any item is successfully rolled, it will be dropped, and if no item is rolled, it is replaced by a regular drop. The order is dragon thrownaxe, dragon knife, hydra's claw, hydra tail, hydra leather and brimstone ring piece. For example, a brimstone ring piece rate follows the formula <math>\frac{1}{180\div(\frac{1999}{2000} \times \frac{1999}{2000} \times \frac{999}{1000} \times \frac{511}{512} \times \frac{511}{512})} = \frac{1}{181.07}</math><br />{{PlainCiteTwitter|author=Mod Munro|url=https://twitter.com/JagexMunro/status/1096054934263525377|date=14 February 2019|archiveurl=http://archive.is/KCMc7|archivedate=16 Apr 2019|quote=Yes, your edit to the wiki is correct.}}</ref>''
