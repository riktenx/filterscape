'''Cerberus''' is a level 318 [[hellhound]] boss who resides in [[Cerberus' Lair]], deep beneath the [[Taverley Dungeon]] in the cave entrance in the north-east part of the hellhound area, which is found beyond the [[poisonous spider]]s. Defeating Cerberus requires a [[Slayer]] level of 91, along with a task of hellhounds or Cerberus herself. In the event of a hellhound or [[Clue scroll (elite) - A demon's best friend|elite clue scroll]] task, [[wild pie]]s may be used to boost the player's Slayer level. While boosting, the player's Slayer level must remain at or above 91.

As the Guardian of the [[River of Souls]], Cerberus protects the souls of the departed from whatever troubles they may face on their journey by the [[Citizens of Arceuus]]. Despite her important task, Cerberus longs to escape her post, and has successfully done so on multiple occasions, although with each attempt she was quickly captured and returned. Cerberus has killed many adventurers who have stumbled into her lair, with one of her more recent kills dropping a [[damaged soul bearer]] which the Arceuus Elders inspected and eventually discarded when they could not repair it.

Cerberus drops three different crystals: the [[eternal crystal|eternal]], [[pegasian crystal|pegasian]], and [[primordial crystal]]s which are used to upgrade the [[infinity boots|infinity]], [[ranger boots|ranger]], and [[dragon boots]] to the [[eternal boots|eternal]], [[pegasian boots|pegasian]], and [[primordial boots]] respectively, which boast best-in-slot bonuses for the [[feet slot]]. She can also drop the [[smouldering stone]] at a much better rate compared to her lesser brethren, along with the [[jar of souls]] and the [[hellpuppy]] [[pet]].

A [[dwarf multicannon]] cannot be set up inside Cerberus' Lair; if attempted, players will receive the message: {{Mes|You cannot place the cannon here, it would melt.}}

*There are 3 different rooms inside [[Cerberus' Lair]] in which [[Cerberus]] can be found.

==Fight overview==
{{Main|Cerberus/Strategies}}
When approaching her, Cerberus will become aggressive. She may attack with magic, ranged and melee attacks, each with a max hit of 23. The magic attack appears as a grey ball, the ranged attack appears as a ball of spikes, and the melee attack is her biting.

Cerberus has three special attacks that she may use under certain circumstances:
* She attacks in quick succession with magic followed by ranged and melee. The melee attack will hit the player even at a distance.
* She summons three [[Summoned Soul|souls]] – indicated by her howling – that come from the river behind her and attack the player with each combat style. Each attack will drain 30 prayer (15 with [[spectral spirit shield]] equipped) if blocked or 30 hitpoints if not blocked.
* She spits three balls of fire on the ground, indicated by a Grrrrrr chat text above her head. One lava spot will land on the player and two in random spots around the room. Standing on or near one will deal continuous damage, which can be reduced with appropriate [[dragonfire]] protection.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Arcane|url=https://twitter.com/JagexArcane/status/1429082258602876930|date=21 August 2021|archiveurl=https://archive.is/yzam9|archivedate=21 August 2021|quote=antifire actually seems to reduce damage from cerberus flame attack}}

If a player has recently fought the boss, a line of [[Flames|fire]] will spawn between the entrance and the boss; stepping over this will deal 5 damage each way. The line of fire may be bugged, as it will not despawn unless the challenger dies to Cerberus or goes back through the line of fire after it respawns and if the player comes back after teleporting away mid-fight. Cerberus will restore all of her health if there are no players in her lair (she is not attackable and only has an examine option when this happens).

Once defeated, Cerberus will respawn in five seconds.

==Trivia==
*In Greek and Roman mythology, {{wp|Cerberus}} is a multi-headed hellhound with a serpent's tail, a mane of snakes, and a lion's claws, guarding the entrance of the Greek underworld to prevent the dead from escaping and the living from entering. This reflects the area around Cerberus as it guards the rivers that take souls to the Underworld and explains the [[jar of souls]] drop.
**Although in its associated mythology Cerberus is male, the [[boss lair display]] refers to the boss in-game as female.
*Cerberus stands on a trapdoor as a reference to the book/film ''{{wp|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}'' (or ''{{wp|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone}}''), in which a three-headed dog guarded a trapdoor. This also helps explain its four stone/crystal drops.
*When bones are used on Cerberus, a message appears saying "Those aren't Cerby snacks". This is a reference to "Scooby Snacks" from ''Scooby-Doo''.
*Cerberus had a festive override wearing a [[green partyhat]], [[black santa hat]], and [[blue partyhat]] during the [[2016 Christmas event/Gallery|2016]], [[2017 Christmas event/Gallery|2017]], [[2018 Christmas event/Gallery|2018]], [[2019 Christmas event/Gallery|2019]], [[2020 Christmas event/Gallery|2020]], [[2021 Christmas event/Gallery|2021]], [[2022 Christmas event/Gallery|2022]], [[2023 Christmas event/Gallery|2023]], and [[2024 Christmas event/Gallery|2024]] Christmas events.
