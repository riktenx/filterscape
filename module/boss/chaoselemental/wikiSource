The '''Chaos Elemental''' is a dark cloud with six tentacles that dwells in the [[members-only]] section of the [[Wilderness]], just west of the [[Rogues' Castle]]. This area is moderately easy to access from the deep [[Wilderness teleport lever]] in [[Ardougne]] or [[Edgeville]]. The nearby [[Wilderness Obelisk]] can randomly [[teleport]] players south-east of the Rogues' Castle, after the [[hard Wilderness Diary]] is completed, the location can be chosen from any Wilderness obelisk.

The Chaos Elemental is generally killed for its [[dragon 2h sword]] and [[dragon pickaxe|pickaxe]] drops. It also has a higher drop rate of the [[pet chaos elemental]] compared to the [[Chaos Fanatic]]. In addition, it is immune to [[venom]]â€”any items that are able to inflict venom will inflict regular [[poison]] instead.

'''{{Colour|red|Warning}}: As this boss is located deep within the Wilderness, and wanders around in a multi-combat zone, beware of player-killers! Do not bring items you are not willing to lose.'''

Killing the Chaos Elemental is a requirement for the [[Hard Wilderness Diary]].

==Trivia==
* The names of the Chaos Elemental's three attacks (Discord, Madness and Confusion) have never been officially stated by Jagex, but are named as such by the accompanying sound effects in the cache.
*It is possible to complete the Chaos Elemental's [[collection log]] without ever fighting the boss by obtaining its drops from alternate sources; the [[pet chaos elemental]] is also dropped by the [[Chaos Fanatic]], while the [[dragon 2h sword]] and [[dragon pickaxe]] are dropped by other Wilderness bosses or the Kalphite Queen.
* "Lethe Napier Flem", a name used by the Chaos Elemental in issue 25 of Postbag from the Hedge{{CitePostbag|issue=25|author=Chaos Elemental|letter=9}}, is an anagram of The Fallen Empire.
* "Dags Gritting! (Rugate Arrestees Heartier)", signed at the end of the Chaos Elemental's letter in issue 30{{CitePostbag|issue=30|author=Chaos Elemental|letter=6}}, is an anagram of "Start Digging! (A Greater Treasure Is There)".
