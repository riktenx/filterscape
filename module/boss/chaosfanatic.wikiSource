[[File:Fighting Chaos Fanatic.png|thumb|right|250px|The green magical attack players should avoid.]]
The '''Chaos Fanatic''' is an insane mage that resides west of the [[Lava Maze]] (level 42 Wilderness). He is surrounded by unattackable [[miniature chaotic clouds]], which serve as scenery. He drops one of three shards required to forge [[Odium ward]]s and [[Malediction ward]]s. He is also one of the only monsters (including [[Mummy|mummies]], [[Calvar'ion]] and the [[thermonuclear smoke devil]]) to drop the [[ancient staff]].

He has a [[special attack]] where he uses a green magical attack that explodes and can deal high damage, similar to the [[Crazy Archaeologist]]'s explosive book attack. Players must run away from them to avoid damage. He is also able to disarm players, much like how the [[Chaos Elemental]] does.

==Getting there==
The fastest way to get there is by casting [[Ghorrock Teleport]] or using its [[Ghorrock teleport (tablet)|magic tablet]] equivalent. Alternatively, a [[burning amulet]] can teleport players to the entrance of the [[Lava Maze]]; run west from there. Alternately, players with the hard [[Wilderness Diary]] completed and a [[Obelisk (Construction)|POH obelisk]] can select the level 44 Wilderness teleport.

==Quotes==
One quote is said every time the Chaos Fanatic attacks the player.

*"''BURN!''"
*"''WEUGH!''"
*"''Devilish Oxen Roll!''"
*"''All your wilderness are belong to them!''"
*"''AhehHeheuhHhahueHuUEehEahAH''"
*"''I shall call him squidgy and he shall be my squidgy!''"

==Trivia==
*The Chaos Fanatic's animation (apart from attacking) is similar to [[Dr Harlow]] before he is sober.
*The Chaos Fanatic's quote "''I shall call him squidgy and he shall be my squidgy!''" is a reference to the Pixar movie ''{{wp|Finding Nemo}}''.
*The Chaos Fanatic's quote "''All your wilderness are belong to them!''" is a reference to the phrase "All your base are belong to us," which originated in the 1989 game ''Zero Wing'' and has made it into many games since then.
*The Chaos Fanatic's quote "''Devilish Oxen Roll!''" is an anagram of "Lord Helix lives on!". This is a reference to a character in the first ''Twitch Plays Pok√©mon'' which ended on March 1st 2014, two weeks before the Chaos Fanatic was added to the game.
*The Chaos Fanatic has disciples, as shown by the [[Lesser Fanatic]] wandering near [[Edgeville]].
