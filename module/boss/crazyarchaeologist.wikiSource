'''Bellock''', the '''crazy archaeologist''', is an insane [[Human|individual]] and [[boss]] who resides in the [[Ruins (west)|ruins]] south of [[The Forgotten Cemetery]] (level 23 Wilderness). He uses [[Ranged]] and [[melee]] attacks and can perform a [[special attack]] where he throws explosive books that explode in a 3x3 area.

Bellock is one of the three [[Wilderness#Bosses|Wilderness bosses]] that drop one of three shards of the [[malediction ward]] and [[odium ward]]. He is particularly popular with low and mid-level ironmen due to his fairly common [[rune crossbow]] drop and relative ease compared to acquiring it from other sources.

The [[deranged archaeologist]] also counts towards a '''crazy archaeologist''' boss [[Slayer task]]. He '''cannot''' be killed as an alternative if the [[Wilderness]] is specified as the task location when the task is received from [[Krystilia]] or [[Konar quo Maten]].

[[File:Fighting the Crazy archaeologist.png|thumb|left|250px|A player fights Bellock, the crazy archaeologist.]]
Despite his high [[Magic]] defence, he has a negligible Magic level, and thus has a weakness to Magic. This is because Magic defence is primarily based on one's Magic level.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/636095399070158848|date=25 August 2015|archiveurl=https://archive.is/hiBO6|archivedate=26 May 2020|quote=NPCs' magic defence is calculated off their Magic level, not their Defence level, and his is negligible.}} Use spells, such as [[Iban Blast]], or a staff, such as the [[Trident of the seas]], while [[praying range]] and avoiding his [[special attack]] of explosive books as soon as he says, "''Rain of knowledge!''" The best way to avoid it is by keeping a considerable distance, and running towards him until you are two squares away from him (this way, you will avoid [[Melee]] damage), and repeating the same steps over and over, you will minimise the chance of receiving damage.

The fastest way to get there is by using the spell [[Dareeyak Teleport]] from the [[Ancient Magicks]] spellbook with 78 [[Magic]] or a [[Dareeyak teleport (tablet)|Dareeyak teleport tablet]]. Alternatively a [[burning amulet]] can be used to teleport to bandit camp and run to the ruins. Alternately you can teleport to Trollheim (61 Magic) and take the agility shortcut to the Wilderness, placing you right next to the ruins.

His location in the Wilderness is single target only, so you cannot be attacked by another player as long as you are in combat with the boss.
