The '''deranged archaeologist''' is a [[boss]] located on [[Fossil Island]], at the southern end of the [[Tar Swamp]]. An [[axe]] is required to chop a swamp vine in order to reach him. Directly before the area is a [[Spine mushroom|spine mushroom]] that will occasionally hit passing players for 10 damage and apply [[poison]].

He's nearly identical to the [[crazy archaeologist]] in terms of [[combat]] - he throws books as a [[Ranged]] attack, and punches and kicks players who stand in [[melee]] range. His [[special attack]] is similar but hits much harder (up to 56 damage per direct hit{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1383758002528800771|date=18 April 2021|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/dMzPN|archivedate=18 April 2021|quote=56, I believe.}}), and he shouts "Learn to Read!" when he uses it. Notably, however, the Deranged archaeologist drops none of the same unique items as the crazy archaeologist. In fact, the Deranged archaeologist is the only non-quest [[boss]] in ''Old School RuneScape'' to have no unique drops.

The deranged archaeologist can be killed in lieu of the crazy archaeologist for [[boss]] [[Slayer task]]s.

==Trivia==
*Upon release, the deranged archaeologist dropped uncharged [[Amulet of glory|amulets of glory]] at an uncommon rate. As the amulet of glory is one of the most coveted early-game [[ironman]] items (which has high requirements - either 83 [[Hunter]] to catch [[dragon impling]]s, or 80 [[Crafting]] to create), this caused player complaints about making it far too easy to obtain. This was changed and now he drops [[crystal key]]s instead.
*Upon release, the deranged archaeologist could be [[safespotted]]. His {{overhead|No hiding!}} attack was soon added to counter this. This was removed later after the NPC was given its own dedicated lair.
*His examine text may be a reference to the "Tears in Rain" monologue from the 1982 {{wp|Ridley Scott}} film ''{{wp|Blade Runner}}''.
