'''Duke Sucellus''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|s|uː|ˈ|k|ɛ|l|ə|s}} {{respell|soo-KELL-əs}}) is a chthonian demon sealed in [[Ghorrock Prison]], who is encountered during [[Desert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire]]. A high-ranking commander of the [[Zarosian Empire]], Sucellus took informal command of the remaining forces of the Empire after the [[Betrayal of Zaros]]. A stronger variant of him can be fought again after the completion of the quest. Duke Sucellus is considered [[Demon (attribute)|demonic]], but is only partially susceptible to [[demonbane weapons]]; such weapons apply only 70% of their demonbane damage and accuracy bonuses against him.

[[Ghorrock Prison]] is accessible from [[Ghorrock Dungeon]], with the dungeon itself being accessible from [[Weiss]]'s [[Salt Mine]]. Players do not have to traverse the entirety of Ghorrock Prison after the completion of the quest, as they will instead directly reach the asylum when going through the main prison entrance.

A [[Scoreboard (Duke Sucellus)|scoreboard]] by the gates leading to the asylum show statistics related to Duke Sucellus.

==History==
[[File:Statue (Duke Sucellus).png|thumb|left|180px|The statue of Duke Sucellus in the Ancient Vault.]]
Duke Sucellus was the leader of [[Zaros]]' Sixth Legion, one of twelve demonic legions from [[Infernus]] sent to [[Gielinor]] at the beginning of the [[Second Age]], and held the rank of Legatus within the [[Zarosian Empire]], which bestowed command of a whole legion. He was also one of four individuals entrusted with a medallion - the means to open the [[Ancient Vault]] where the [[Elder Horn]] was sealed - alongside [[Perseriya]], [[Vardorvis]], and [[the Whisperer]], all of whom were high-ranking personnel in the Empire.

At some point during the [[Third Age]], after the [[Betrayal of Zaros]], Sucellus was sent to [[Ghorrock]], where he became Acting Legatus Maximus (the rank previously held by [[Zamorak]]) and took informal command over what little forces of the [[Zarosian Empire]] remained. During his time in Ghorrock, he took in many refugees from the Empire who managed to make their way there. As the [[God Wars]] dragged on, the fortress was close to running out of room,{{CiteText|text=Refugees note|quote=Another hundred refugees arrived today. This war has already lasted multiple lifetimes for the lesser races, and there is no end in sight. I ask once again that we consider our capacity here. I do not wish to turn away those who are still faithful, but we are running out of room.}} with some humans having been born there and never leaving the fortress.{{CiteText|text=Request note|quote=I understand the need for security, but some of the humans have spent their entire lives in this place. Giving them a glimpse of the outside could be a much needed morale boost for everyone.}}

By the end of the [[God Wars]], Sucellus moved to the prison asylum and began ordering preparations to return to the surface.{{CiteText|text=Prisoner's letter|quote=Something isn't right. The war is over and the gods are gone. We should be leaving this place, but instead we remain. Apparently, the Duke requires us to make preparations before we return to the surface, but there is something we are not being told.}} However, suspicions were raised after more and more people who were taken to the asylum never returned.{{CiteText|text=Prisoner's letter|quote=The Duke hasn't left the asylum in days, and every day, more people are taken down there... never to return. I feel something terrible is fast approaching. We must leave before it does.}} In reality, Sucellus believed that he was the one destined to restore the Empire to its former glory, and ate everyone who was brought to the asylum in order to absorb their essence and gain more power.{{CiteText|text=Warning letter|quote=If you're reading this, you've no doubt already seen the horrifying truth for yourself. The Duke thinks he's destined to restore the empire, at the small cost of all our lives!}}{{CiteText|text=Evacuation note|quote=He ate them... He ate them all!}} This would seem to be the explanation for the tremendous difference in appearance between statues of the Duke seen in Ghorrock's Prison and the Ancient Vault, and Sucellus' current form.

Realising the threat Sucellus posed, [[Jhallan]] and [[Mizzarch]] began to make preparations to seal the prison, handing out evacuation orders to leave within the hour.{{CiteText|text=Evacuation note|quote=Ghorrock is forsaken and must be evacuated at once. Round up all who are left and tell them they have an hour to leave. Jhallan and Mizzarch are preparing to have this place sealed.}} The two [[Mahjarrat]] would each take one half of the Ghorrock Crest used to seal the prison, though it is likely Mizzarch's crest came into [[Hazeel]]'s possession after his sacrifice at one of their rituals, where-after it fell into the hands of the [[Carnillean family]], though it is unlikely they were ever aware of its significance.{{CiteNPC|npc=Hazeel|quote=Half of the crest used to do so came into my possession, but it was seemingly taken by the Carnilleans after my defeat.|loc=Secrets of the North}} The prison was successfully sealed shut, leaving anyone unlucky enough to have not evacuated to die cold, abandoned deaths, or else be eaten by their despotic host. Sucellus remained in the asylum and, eventually running out of food, fell into a very long, deep slumber.

During the [[Fifth Age]], the prison would be unsealed by an [[assassin]] later revealed to be [[Sliske]]. [[player character|An adventurer]] who sought his medallion ventured into the prison, discovering the slumbering Sucellus. After the adventurer woke him up with poison, Sucellus attempted to consume their essence, but was swiftly subdued. He fell back into slumber, while the adventurer discovered his medallion in a locked chest that required a [[Odd key|key]] he had on him.

==Fight overview==
{{Main|Duke Sucellus/Strategies}}
Unlike the other members of [[the Forgotten Four]], Duke Sucellus is not available to fight immediately; rather, he is in a deep slumber and must be weakened with mushrooms or [[Arder-musca poison]] before he is forcefully woken up to fight.
[[File:Fighting Duke Sucellus.png|left|thumb|A player fighting Duke Sucellus.]]
When in melee range (including diagonally across) and a few other select tiles, Duke Sucellus will raise his arms, causing icicles to spike up from the ground and follow up with a slam attack. The slam attack is significantly more powerful than the icicles and will deal heavy damage, even with [[Protect from Melee]] enabled. If the player is outside of melee range and not on those other select tiles, Sucellus will spit a magical cluster of energy that also deals high damage (but less than the slam) even through [[Protect from Magic]].

After five standard attacks, he will unleash a freezing gaze at the player, dealing massive damage if they are not hiding behind a pillar. After the first iteration of this attack, he will launch a Gas Flare after three auto-attacks that ignites the vent closest to the player. 

As his health lowers, Sucellus will begin to change up his attack rotation, such as two auto-attacks before a Gas Flare and launching it two flares per iteration upon reaching ~50% of his health. Upon reaching 25% of his health, Sucellus will enter an enrage phase, attacking one tick faster.

After the Duke is defeated, he remains 'dead' for a few seconds and his drops appear in front of him, before beginning to sleep again.

==Drops==
{{DropLogProject|kills=318722}}

===Average value===
Drop values are listed by whether you include the [[Magus ring|Magus Ring]] and [[Soulreaper Axe]] components, which must be completed to be sold, as well as if your kill was credited as perfect.{{BossValue/Duke Sucellus}}

===Mechanics===
When Duke Sucellus is defeated, a drop will be rolled for until the roll results in a success, as described below:{{CiteNews|url=https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/desert-treasure-ii---tweaks-and-drop-rates?oldschool=1|title=Desert Treasure II - Tweaks and Drop Rates|newsdate=3 August 2023}}
* Roll 1/90 for the tradeable unique drop table (1/30 for awakened variant).
** If unsuccessful, roll 1/48 for the [[awakener's orb]].
** If unsuccessful, roll 1/25 for [[frozen tablet]].
** If unsuccessful, roll 1/200 for [[ice quartz]].
** If unsuccessful, roll 1/5 for the supply drop table.
* If all rolls above were unsuccessful, the standard drop table is rolled.
* Once the player rolls the entire drop table, roll 1/2,500 for [[Baron]] and 1/40 for a clue scroll.

In addition, defeating the boss perfectly will earn 50% more loot from the standard drop table.{{CiteReddit|author=Mod Ayiza|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/15gzjui/desert_treasure_ii_tweaks_and_drop_rates/julpslb/|date=3 August 2023|archiveurl=https://archive.li/lVplt|archivedate=3 August 2023|quote=You have to do the fight while avoiding any avoidable damage. Essentially a perfect fight (chip damage does not count).|title=Desert Treasure II - Tweaks and Drop Rates}} This requires the player to kill Duke Sucellus without taking any avoidable damage, which includes:
* Melee attacks from his slam attack (the chip damage taken from the rising icicles are considered unavoidable)
* Standard magic attack (praying against them will still fail the achievement, even when hit for a 0)
* Damage from the Freezing Gaze attack
* Damage from ignited gas vents in both the preparation and battle phases
* Damage from ice fall and [[Extremity|extremities]]
* In the awakened fight, avoid taking poison damage and being hit by a shadow orb

==Trivia==
* {{wp|Sucellus}} is the name of a Gallo-Roman god associated with agriculture and wine.
* The design of Duke Sucellus appears to be heavily inspired by ''Runescape 3''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> [[RSW:Senecianus|Senecianus]], which both bear strong resemblances to the shoggoths of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos.
* In ''RuneScape'', Sucellus was also a Zarosian duke, though his role was far different - following the destruction of the Zarosian Empire, he devised a long-term plan to steal Saradomin's crown by inserting the Temple Knights as a Saradominist organization. He also died of unknown means.
* The room Sucellus is fought in greatly resembles a room found in the ''RuneScape'' quest "Twilight of the Gods",  inside the [[Senntisten]] Asylum.
* Originally, the fight had four types of mushrooms available to be picked from - [[arder mushroom|arder]], [[musca mushroom|musca]], [[resper mushroom|resper]], and [[holos mushrooms]] - which could be used on the [[Fermentation Vat]] to create six combinations of poisons to weaken Duke Sucellus. Presumably, all but one were scrapped to make the fight simpler.
