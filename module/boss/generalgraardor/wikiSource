'''General Graardor''' is the leader of [[Bandos]]' forces within the [[God Wars Dungeon]]. He is the only known living member of the [[Ourg]] race.

He is found in [[Bandos' Stronghold]], which requires a [[Strength]] level of 70 and a [[hammer]] to access. To enter his quarters, players must have an [[ecumenical key]] in their inventory or have killed 40<ref>35 for hard, 30 for elite, 25 for master and 15 kills for grandmaster for those who have unlocked the respective combat achievement tiers</ref> of Bandos' followers throughout the dungeon, with [[goblin]]s being the easiest of the followers to kill.

{{Main|General Graardor/Strategies}}
Like other God Wars Dungeon bosses, Graardor roams around a rectangular room with his bodyguards until a player enters, attacking them on sight. He attacks primarily with [[melee]] (2/3 chance{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/689065027844878338|date=17 January 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/0LEUP|archivedate=29 March 2019|quote=2/3 melee, 1/3 "ranged".|name=attack chance}}), and his bodyguards use a different combat style each. Graardor may also use a [[ranged]] attack (1/3 chance{{NamedRef|attack chance}}) where he slams the ground, hitting all players in the room which has an equal chance to hit between 15-35 upon successfully hitting the player.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1054823168559538177|date=23 October 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/USdjg|archivedate=26 May 2020|quote=[Graardor's ranged attack is] rolling 15-35 inclusive, with equal chances for each of those 21 numbers.}} Despite it being a Ranged attack, Graardor can only use it if he is within melee range of his current target. If there are no players in his chamber, his health and stats will be reset.
