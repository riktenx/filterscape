[[File:Fighting Grotesque Guardians.png|right|thumb|300px|A player fights the Grotesque Guardians.]]
The '''Grotesque Guardians''' are a pair of [[gargoyle]]s, [[Dusk]] and [[Dawn]], found on the [[Slayer Tower]]'s rooftop, whose entrance is found on the {{FloorNumber|uk=2}}. In order to access the roof for the first time, players must obtain a [[brittle key]] from [[Gargoyle|gargoyles]] while assigned them for a [[Slayer task]] (requiring 75 Slayer). 

Similar to other [[Slayer]] [[bosses]], such as [[Cerberus]] and the [[Abyssal Sire]], the Grotesque Guardians can only be killed while the player is assigned gargoyles or the Guardians themselves as a Slayer task. Players attempting to use the stairs to the roof without the proper Slayer task (having unlocked the stairway gates with the brittle key prior) will be stopped via dialogue and not proceed. 

{{ToC|left}}
Despite Dusk and Dawn being two different entities, killing both guardians only counts as one kill due to Dusk absorbing Dawn's essence. However, if the player has the ''[[Slayer rewards#Unlock|Double Trouble]]'' perk unlocked, Dawn's death will also be included, although Dusk still needs to be killed and the full boss fight completed in order to receive experience and task progression. 

Upon Dusk's death, 1350 Slayer experience is rewarded, with additional tiers of the [[Morytania Diary]] completed you can attain more xp, with an additonal 33.75 slayer xp after completing the easy tier, 67.5 slayer xp with the medium tier, 101.5 xp with the hard tier, and 135 additional slayer xp awarded with the elite tier, capping out at 1485 slayer xp. Slayer experience per kill is not affected by the ''[[Slayer rewards#Unlock|Double Trouble]]'' perk.

The Grotesque Guardians are fought in a solo [[instance]].

==History==
A [[Dorgeshuun]] goblin during the [[God Wars]] left a written record entitled [[The living statues]] detailing their account of how the Grotesque Guardians (as well as the [[gargoyle]]s on the top floor) came to be animated.{{citeText|text=The living statues|quote=As I ran down the stairs through the lower floors, I saw that the many hideous statues we passed had also come to life.}}

The animated statues were created by the [[Bandos]]ian general [[Snaarldor]] during the God Wars. Bandos sought to bolster his troops with more durable fighters than the goblins he'd been using, such as the [[Dorgeshuun]]. He sent Snaarldor and a group of goblins to the [[Slayer tower]] ([[Viggora's Folly]]) to achieve this.{{citeText|text=The living statues|quote=The Big High Idiot wanted the war to go on for eternity, but all the goblins, including me, were too squishy for his needs. He wanted some new foot soldiers that could take a harder beating and deliver it as well. He could probably have created these soldiers himself, but he was too busy throwing punches with Armadyl, so he decided to appoint some lackeys for the job. Unfortunately, that included me.}} Creating an incantation circle with stakes made of Bandos's metal (the same metal used in [[Bandos armour]]), along with a [[Black tourmaline core|large hunk of tourmaline]], Snaarldor performed the ritual at high noon, instructing his soldiers to strike the bell once the tourmaline core began to sink into the floor.{{citeText|text=The living statues|quote=Snaarldor carried a large hunk of tourmaline with him, shaped like a heart. [...] I wasn't sure what it was for, but apparently it had some kind of reaction when it came into contact with the metal that the Big High Idiot created. We were supposed to use it to create some kind of device and perform a ritual around it.}}

When the bell was struck, a surge of black energy pulsed from the bell, causing the statues on the rooftop, as well as the lower floors, to come to life. Snaarldor proceeded to order the Guardians to fight for Bandos, attacking the forces of [[Armadyl]], [[Saradomin]] and [[Zamorak]].{{citeText|text=The living statues|quote=Ecstatic with his creation, Snaarldor gave a big speech about the glory of the Big High War God and the such, as if he expected some lumps of carved rock to understand a single thing. After that, Snaarldor gave commands to fight against the forces of Armadyl, Saradomin, and Zamorak.}} Upon the mention of the last name, the two gargoyles immediately tilted their heads, which Snaarldor believed to be having gained their loyalty. Snaarldor's assistant, a [[Dorgeshuun]] goblin, knew otherwise and tried to warn him of it, but the ourg threatened him.{{citeText|text=The living statues|quote=The guardians turned their head at the lattermost name. Snaarldor thought this meant that he had gained their loyalty. However, I knew better than to think that. Viggora was a follower of Zamorak, and I knew the tower would be filled with his magic. I wanted to tell Snaarldor this, but once again he threatened me with a long list of what he would do to me.}} Before Snaarldor could finish his threat, he was immediately swept in a blur, as the two gargoyles began fighting him, swatting away his ork soldiers who tried to beat them off their general.{{citeText|text=The living statues|quote=Before he could finish his threat, he vanished from my line of sight in a blur, and the next second I was blown away from behind. I was sent tumbling until I was stopped by the wall. Once my head stopped spinning, I witnessed the statues attacking Snaarldor. The orks tried to beat them off their general, but they were simply swatted away by the stone wings.}}

Exchanging strikes mid-air, Snaarldor managed to break one of Dusk's wings, but fell to the ground, while the Guardians returned to the top of the tower. After getting up from the fall, Snaarldor called for his soldiers to retreat.{{citeText|text=The living statues|quote=I looked up and saw the hulking bodies of Snaarldor and one of the statues exchanging strikes in mid air. Snaarldor landed a chop that broke off a wing, and they both fell. The statue landed back on top of the tower while Snaarldor made contact with the nearby swamp. After getting up from the fall, Snaarldor immediately called for his remaining forces to retreat.}}

Today, the Grotesque Guardians remain on the rooftop, in which its entrance is locked.

==The fight==
''Like [[gargoyles]], players '''must''' bring a [[rock hammer]], [[rock thrownhammer]], or [[granite hammer]] to finish them off.''

To initiate the fight, players must ring [[the Cloister Bell]] in the north side of the roof. This will trigger a cutscene in which the Guardians will awaken, and the fight will begin. If players have killed the Guardians more than five times, the Cloister Bell will have a "Quick-start" option, which will skip the cutscene and start the fight directly. Attempting to ring the bell again before the fight is over will yield the message ''Concentrate on your fight!'' in the chatbox.

Two combat styles are required for this fight; ideally [[Ranged]] and [[Melee]]. Dawn is flying and cannot be reached with any melee weapon, while also being more resistant to magic instead of ranged, and Dusk is immune to non-melee damage. 

After being awoken, the Guardians will initiate combat with the player. Dusk will cover himself with his wing, which protects him from all damage. The player must attack Dawn until she reaches half health, after which she flies upwards and out of sight.

During this phase of the fight, Dusk's wings may glow, and will perform an explosive attack. If players do not run away from him when he does so, the player will be dealt up to 33 damage and be knocked back. In addition, debris may fall around the roof, which can deal up to 22 damage and [[Stun (status)|stun]] players for a brief period of time. Once his health has reached half, Dawn will return and perform a lightning special attack with Dusk that has an AoE of 3x3, rapidly dealing up to 5-10 damage per tick.

After the lightning attacks, Dawn will send out three [[energy sphere]]s that will grow larger over time, while Dusk covers himself again, so they should focus on Dawn. If players do not absorb these spheres in time, each will heal Dawn for 90 [[Hitpoints]].

After killing Dawn, Dusk will absorb her essence, increasing his stats (barring his health) and having the ability to use her ranged attacks alongside his melee ones, initiating the last phase of the fight. At the start of this phase and periodically afterwards, Dusk will grab the player to a random location and imprison them in a prison of flames, which they must escape or take heavy damage which heals him in the process.

==Drops==
{{DropLogProject|kills=35446}}

''In addition to the 100% drop of [[granite dust]], the player will also have two rolls on the Grotesque Guardians' drop table, including unique items but not tertiary items. The drop rates in the drop table below reflect the chance of getting an item for every roll on the standard loot table, which means the effective drop rate is approximately double the listed numbers per kill. Unlike the [[Kalphite Queen#Drops|Kalphite Queen]], you are '''not''' guaranteed to get a food or potion drop each kill. The chance of getting any unique from the Grotesque Guardians is 1/48, although this includes the Granite Maul which also appears on the drop table of regular Gargoyles.''

==Trivia==
*Due to the large amount of slayer xp rewarded from each kill (1350-1485 based on Morytania Diary tier) and the HP total of 950, unless you have a very low DPS, you make more slayer xp than HP xp per kill, leading to people killing the Grotesque Guardians for extra progress towards an untrimmed slayer cape.
*As a result of the update that decreased the Grotesque Guardians' hitpoints, Dusk's combat level fell from 285 to 246, while Dawn's fell from 266 to 228; when Dawn was killed, Dusk's combat level increased to 324 (previously, this was 366). 
**During the cutscene when the Guardians awaken however, they still retain their original combat levels.
*Originally players used a portal to access the Guardians. This was changed into a staircase in an update to make it thematically appropriate.
*On their death, the examine text for Dusk or Dawn will be "The crack of Dusk." or "The crack of Dawn." respectively.
*The Grotesque Guardians fight starts by ringing a bell and takes place on a rooftop, the same as the Bell Gargoyles boss fight from the game Dark Souls.
*[[The Cloister Bell]] used to initiate the fight is a reference to the alarm sound of the same name from Doctor Who.
