[[File:Kalphitequeengroup.png|alt=seven players in veracs killing the kalphite queen|thumb|A group of players killing the Kalphite Queen]]
The '''Kalphite Queen''' ('''''Kalphiscarabeinae pasha'''''<ref>Display case in [[Varrock Museum]] natural history exhibit, southern wing. "Kalphite Queen (Kalphiscarabeinae Pasha)"</ref>), also called the '''KQ''', is the strongest of the Kalphites. The Kalphite Queen, along with [[dust devil]]s and [[smoke devil]]s, is notable for dropping the [[Dragon chainbody]].
The Kalphite Queen is also notable as one of two places, outside of the [[Wilderness]], where players can obtain a [[Dragon pickaxe]] (the other being [[Volcanic Mine]]). The Kalphite Queen can inflict large amounts of damage with her [[Ranged]] and [[Magic]] attacks as they always result in a [[successful hit]]. It is recommended for players to bring an emergency teleport such as an [[Ectophial]], [[royal seed pod]] or [[teleport tablet]], or only bring items into the [[Kalphite Lair|lair]] for which they are willing to pay the gravestone fees.

Killing her is a requirement for the [[Hard Desert Diary]]. Talking to the queen's [[Kalphite Queen head (mounted)|mounted head]] in your [[player-owned house|POH]] is a requirement for the [[Elite Desert Diary]].

The Kalphite Queen resides in the [[Kalphite Lair]] south-west of the [[Shantay Pass]]. Two [[rope]]s are required to access the lair, one to enter the dungeon itself and another to reach the lower level where Kalphite Queen resides. A rope is consumed in process of entering the dungeon. Completion of the [[hard Desert Diary]] makes these ropes permanent once placed.

With the completion of the elite Desert Diary, a [[Crevice (Kalphite Lair)|crevice]] shortcut can be used with level 86 [[Agility]]. The shortcut connects the lair's entrance to the entrance of the lower level.

Players with access to [[Dorgesh-Kaan]] can find a tunnel in the [[Dorgesh-Kaan South Dungeon]] that leads through to the Kalphite Lair, emerging near the [[Kalphite worker]]s.

==Fight overview==
{{Main|Kalphite Queen/Strategies}}
[[File:Fighting Kalphite Queen.png|thumb|250px|A player fights the airborne form of the Kalphite Queen.]]
The Kalphite Queen has a [[combat level]] of 333. Each form has 255 [[Hitpoints]], and her [[Ranged]] and [[Magic]] attacks have 100% accuracy.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/606032495704801281|date=3 June 2015|archiveurl=https://archive.is/raBDO|archivedate=26 May 2020}} She may also use a decently accurate [[melee]] attack.

Each of her attacks has a max hit of 31. Her Ranged attacks consist of her shooting barbed spines from her abdomen. Her Ranged attacks will drain 1 prayer point (which may be reduced by [[spectral spirit shield]]). If there are players close to the person being targeted with this attack they will also be hit. To avoid this, players can stand on opposite sides of the Kalphite Queen. Her Magic attack bounces from player to player.

In addition to her highly accurate attacks, the Kalphite Queen also makes use of overhead [[Protection prayers]]. However, unlike other prayer-using monsters (such as [[Sigmund]]), these '''do not''' provide full immunity, but rather improved defence against them. The first form will simultaneously have [[Protect from Magic]] and [[Protect from Missiles]] active, while the second form will only have [[Protect from Melee]] active. While it's possible to kill the Queen with one combat style, it is recommended to bring two for an easier fight.

[[File:Kalphite queen transformation.png|thumb|250px|The Kalphite Queen transforming to her second form.]]

When the first form is killed, it takes 20 [[RuneScape clock|game ticks]] (12 seconds) for the transition into the second airborne form. During this transformation, an animation can be seen where [[Kalphite queen legs|Kalphite Queen legs]] fall to the ground while the Kalphite Queen sheds her exoskeleton.

If the second form stays alive for over 20 minutes, she will revert to the first form and retain the second form's remaining [[hitpoints]]. When the first form is killed again, a second form with full health will emerge, akin to [[Vet'ion]].

If stat-draining [[special attacks]] are used on her first form, the stat reductions will carry over to the second form.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/861503532712722432|date=8 May 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/Ck9G5|archivedate=26 May 2020|quote=Yes [when the defence is lowered on KQ's first form it stays lowered on the second form], same with Vet'ion.}}
