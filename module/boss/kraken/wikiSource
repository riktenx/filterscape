The '''Kraken''' is a stronger and larger version of the [[cave kraken]]. It requires level 87 [[Slayer]] to kill and cannot be boosted. Located at the [[Kraken Cove]], it can only be attacked if the player has cave krakens as a [[Slayer task]], which also requires level 50 [[Magic]]. Alongside its [[Cave kraken|non-boss variants]], it is the only monster that drops the [[trident of the seas]] and [[Kraken tentacle]].

Like its smaller brethren, the Kraken is submerged underwater. Magic is the only reliable way of dealing damage to it, as Ranged deals 1/7th of its normal damage{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1699360516488011950|date=6 September 2023|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/lu26N|archivedate=6 September 2023|quote=If you rolled 0 damage, it stays as 0. If you rolled >=1 damage, it's divided by 7, with a floor of 1. Accuracy is not affected.}}, and it cannot be reached with Melee weapons. To start the fight, players can use a [[fishing explosive]] on the large whirlpool. Otherwise, the four whirlpools around must first be disturbed; when all four whirlpools are disturbed, the larger one can be disturbed, which will result in the Kraken waking up. Both methods will release level 112 [[Enormous Tentacle]]s, which attack with [[Magic]]. 

Both the Kraken and its tentacles attack with magic; the Kraken can hit very hard, but has very poor accuracy, while the tentacles are much more accurate but deal less damage. The Kraken and its tentacles use [[Typeless]] Magic, and as such [[Protect from Magic]] does '''not''' provide any degree of damage reduction. The Kraken's projectile resembles [[Fire Wave]].

Players can create a Kraken instance for 25,000 coins. This fee can be deducted directly from the bank; players do not need to carry coins on them to create the instance.

==Trivia==
*The Kraken uses the same in-game model as the [[Sea Troll Queen]] from the [[Swan Song]] quest, but recoloured. Likewise, its tentacles also use the model of the [[Tentacle (Temple Trekking)|tentacles]] encountered in [[Temple Trekking]], also recoloured.
*Its examine text and the [[jar of dirt]] are references to ''{{wp|Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest}}'' and its sequel ''{{wp|Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End}}''.
*The Kraken had a festive override wearing a [[santa hat]] during the [[2016 Christmas event/Gallery|2016]], [[2017 Christmas event/Gallery|2017]], [[2018 Christmas event/Gallery|2018]], [[2019 Christmas event/Gallery|2019]], [[2020 Christmas event/Gallery|2020]], [[2021 Christmas event/Gallery|2021]], [[2022 Christmas event/Gallery|2022]], [[2023 Christmas event/Gallery|2023]], and [[2024 Christmas event/Gallery|2024]] Christmas events.
*The {{WP|Kraken}} is a mythological creature originating from Norse folklore.
*According to former ''Old School RuneScape'' content developer [[Mod Reach]], the Kraken's underwhelming damage output is due to what he described as a [[game engine]] [[bug]] that, despite his protests, [[Jagex]] ultimately decided to adopt as a feature of the boss.{{CiteVideo|author=Mod Shauny|title=In the Games Industry - An interview with ex-Mod Reach!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i55LS-y1ULg&t=9683s|timestamp=2h41m23s|date=28 January 2020|site=|notes=|name=}}
** Because of this bug, the Kraken's intended Defence level of 150 and Magic level of 390 were both set to 1.
