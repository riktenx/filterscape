'''K'ril Tsutsaroth''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|,|k|r|I|l|_|'|t|V|d|z|i:|r|Q|T}} {{respell|KRILL|_|TUTT|zee|roth}}{{CiteGeneral|url=http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Pronunciation_Guide|title=Pronunciation Guide|accessdate=2022-4-21|author=Jagex|archiveurl=https://chisel.weirdgloop.org/oldwiki/archive1/services.runescape.com/m%3drswiki/en/Pronunciation_Guide.html|archivedate=2016-07-31}}) is the leader of [[Zamorak]]'s forces in the [[God Wars Dungeon]]. 

He is located in [[Zamorak's Fortress]], which requires a [[Hitpoints]] level of 70 to cross the river to access. To gain access to his chamber, players must use an [[ecumenical key]] or have slain 40<ref>35 for hard, 30 for elite, 25 for master and 15 kills for grandmaster for those who have unlocked the respective combat achievement tiers</ref> Zamorakians throughout the dungeon.

He is typically killed on a [[Slayer task]] - K'ril Tsutsaroth is classified as a [[greater demon]], and thus killing him counts towards any greater demon Slayer task and allows a player to take advantage of the damage boosting effects of a [[Black mask]] or [[Slayer helmet]]. As a demon, he is also susceptible to [[demonbane weapon]]s and [[demonbane spells|spells]].

[[File:Fighting K'ril Tsutsaroth.png|thumb|300px|A group of players fighting K'ril Tsutsaroth and his bodyguards.]]
Like other God Wars Dungeon bosses, K'ril roams around a rectangular room with his bodyguards until a player enters, attacking them on sight. He attacks with melee and magic, and if his target is praying [[Protect from Melee]], he can use a devastating melee special attack that hits through prayer. The melee attack has a maximum hit of 46, the magic attack hits from 10-30{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1055016564595011585|date=24 October 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/z0Y5o|archivedate=26 May 2020|quote=Zilyana has a 10-20 attack and K'ril has a 10-30 attack.}} and the special attack hits from 35-49{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1247599267910467584|date=7 April 2020|archiveurl=https://archive.is/RSH4O|archivedate=26 May 2020|quote=Its damage is random, 35-49 inclusive, even distribution across those numbers.}}, as well as drains half of the player's current prayer points. The relative occurrences of the attacks are 2/3 for melee and 1/3 for magic. Barring a complex mechanic, K'ril will use his special on 1 in every 9 hits instead of a melee attack, which gives it an incidence of 2/27 in total.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1247602346496004096|date=7 April 2020|archiveurl=https://archive.is/CFZMo|archivedate=26 May 2020|quote=The melee one looks more like a 2/3 to me, from the code, but the enraged attack would be part of that too, so it'd be less than 2/3 in practice.}}
If all players leave, his health and stats will be reset.

*[[Balfrug Kreeyath]] ([[Magic]])
*[[Tstanon Karlak]] ([[Melee]])

The average K'ril Tsutsaroth kill, including its unique drops, is worth {{Coins|floor({{Average drop value|raw=y}})}}. 

Excluding unique drops, the average kill is worth {{Coins|floor({{Average drop value|raw=y}} - {{#var:krilUnique}})}}. 

Killing the three minions yields an additional {{Coins|floor(3 * {{Average drop value|mob=Balfrug Kreeyath|raw=y}})}} on average (including uniques), bringing the total to {{Coins|floor({{Average drop value|raw=y}} + 3 * {{Average drop value|mob=Balfrug Kreeyath|raw=y}})}} per kill.
