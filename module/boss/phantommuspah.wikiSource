The '''Phantom Muspah''' is a solo [[boss]] that can be fought after completion of the [[quest]] [[Secrets of the North]]. It is the leftover energy of the [[Strange Creature]] that manifested after the events of the quest.

The Phantom Muspah is stronger than its quest variant, but otherwise shares the same attacks and mechanics. All forms of the Phantom Muspah have 33% freeze resistance, meaning it will only stay frozen for 66% of the base freeze duration of [[ice spells]]. 

If players die against the Muspah, their [[grave]] will appear outside the lair in the [[Ghorrock Dungeon]]. When the Muspah is defeated, it will respawn after 30 seconds.

The Phantom Muspah's lair is accessible from [[Ghorrock Dungeon]], with the dungeon itself being accessible from [[Weiss]]'s [[Salt Mine]]. The lair can be entered from a crevice south-west of the dungeon.

A [[Scoreboard (Phantom Muspah)|scoreboard]] by the crevice shows statistics related to the Phantom Muspah.

==Fight overview==
{{Main|Phantom Muspah/Strategies}}
The Phantom Muspah alternates between a ranged form and a melee form roughly every 100 damage in ranged form and 80 damage in melee form that it takes. In its range form it spits green ranged projectiles, is weakest to ranged, and occasionally charges a powerful magic attack. The magic attack can hit up to 72 and applies [[Corruption (status)|corruption]] which drains prayer over time, but is fully blocked by quickly switching to [[Protect from Magic]]. In its melee form it uses melee attacks that deal increasingly more damage the longer the Muspah stays still, even through prayer. In this form it is weakest to magic, and must be frozen or kited around.

When changing forms it spawns a few spikes around the arena including one under the player, which should be dodged or else it will knock the player aside and heal the Muspah based on damage dealt.

It has two special attacks that it uses at 637 (75%) and 425 (50%) health. If it spawns in ranged form it uses Lightning Clouds first, otherwise it uses Homing Spikes first.
* '''Lightning Clouds''' - The Phantom Muspah will rapidly teleport around the arena, leaving behind lightning clouds that travel across the area, which also must be avoided.
* '''Homing Spikes''' - The Phantom Muspah will slam the ground, causing 1-4 spikes to slowly home in on the player for ~20 seconds.

[[File:Fighting Phantom Muspah.png|thumb|left|250px|A player fighting the Phantom Muspah.]]
Upon reaching less than 127 health, the Phantom Muspah will teleport to the centre of the arena and unleash a massive shock wave that must be avoided by standing behind a spike. It then activates a prayer shield; during this shielded phase it attacks similarly to its ranged phase, along with use of the overhead [[Soul Split]] prayer and summoning additional spikes that appear under the player. The shield should be drained via using [[Smite]] in between its attacks, and/or using [[Sapphire bolts (e)|enchanted sapphire bolts]].

After the shield is depleted it will return to its ranged form and spawn large numbers of spikes until defeated.

== Trivia ==
*In ''RuneScape'', the [[rsw:Muspah|Muspah]] are a race of creatures created by the [[Gods|Elder God]] [[Mah]], as an amalgamation of the most fearsome creatures from her nightmares. In ''Old School RuneScape'', no other Muspah exist in the game, and little is known about the creatures' lore as of yet, but their origin story could likely be similar to their counterparts in ''RuneScape'', as evidenced by their examine text ({{mes|Imagination gone wild.}}) and the examine text of the [[Strange Creature]] ({{mes|A creature of nightmares.}}).
*The Muspah may have been named after {{WP|Muspelheim}}, the land of raging fire in Old Norse mythology.
*Physical similarities and a previous cannonball drop of 666 may be a reference to <i>{{wp|Diablo II}}</i>'s demon Duriel.
*The "[[Scoreboard (Phantom Muspah)|scoreboard]]" plaque across from the entrance has Morse code that translates to "YOU GOT THIS BUDDY"
