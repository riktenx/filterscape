'''Sarachnis''', the mother of the [[temple spider]]s, is a mid-level boss found in the [[Forthos Dungeon]], in a former burial tomb south of the Spider Den. She can be killed as part of a [[spider]] [[Slayer task]].

[[Forthos Dungeon]]'s burial tomb is in the southern-most part of the dungeon. The dungeon can be entered via entrance inside and east of the [[Forthos Ruin]].

Players will need a [[slash weapon]] or a [[knife]] to be able to pass through the [[webs]] that block access to where Sarachnis is located, unless using [[Aranea boots|Aranea Boots]]. The same webs can be peeked through to see how many player are inside the tomb. The last [[thick web]]s that block access to the tomb do not need a slash weapon or a knife to be slashed through.

==Strategy==
{{Main|Sarachnis/Strategies}}
Sarachnis attacks with [[melee]] when players are adjacent to her, and [[ranged]] when they are out of melee range; she also heals upon dealing damage. Her attacks are accurate and can hit up to 31, so it is important to pray against her attacks correctly. Every four attacks, she will bind the player with a web that deals no damage but prevents them from moving for a few seconds, and will then move somewhere else in the arena. The web's duration can be shortened via transmog rings such as the [[ring of stone]], or fully negated with [[aranea boots]]. Players should use [[Protect from Missiles]] when Sarachnis shoots the web to block her next ranged attack, then quickly close to melee range and switch back to [[Protect from Melee]]. If done perfectly, players will take no damage from her attacks.

When fighting Sarachnis with two or more players, she will only target one player after she moves. If the targeted player is out of melee range, she will use her ranged attack on everyone in the arena. If the targeted player moves within melee range, she will only attack the targeted player with melee.

At 66% and 33% health, Sarachnis will summon two [[Spawn of Sarachnis|Spawns of Sarachnis]], an orange melee user on the west side of the room, and a blue magic user on the east side of the room. It is recommended to tank the hits from the melee spawn, and kill the magic spawn when it appears. While doing this, the player should pray ranged as Sarachnis' ranged attacks are more dangerous than the spawns.

Upon Sarachnis' death, all her [[Spawn_of_Sarachnis|spawns]] will die as well. Sarachnis will then [[respawn]] in 10 seconds.

==Trivia==
*Upon examining the [[egg sac]]s in Sarachnis' lair, the chatbox will state {{mes|It's making sounds inside. It's going to hatch soon!}} This is the verbatim message that is given upon checking the status of a Pokémon egg that will hatch soon in ''Pokémon Gold'', ''Silver'', and ''Crystal''.
*Sarachnis was originally going to be an instanced solo boss, but was reworked into a non-instanced boss in a [[multicombat area]] after player complaints about the abundance of bosses being fought in instances already.
*Her food drop, [[egg potato]]es, could be thematically interpreted as a food made from spider eggs.
*Sarachnis is one of the few [[NPCs]] in the game that can sprint. Whenever she uses her web attack, she sprints to her next location moving 2 tiles per tick. This makes hitting her while she moves very inconsistent as her model is not representative of where she is.
