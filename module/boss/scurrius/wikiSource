'''Scurrius, the Rat King''' is a [[boss]] residing in the [[Varrock Sewers]]. As a mid-level boss meant for players with a combat level of 60-90, Scurrius is meant to introduce various mechanics that are present in higher-level play, such as switching [[protection prayers]] quickly during combat as well as dodging attacks and managing multiple monsters mid-fight.

Scurrius can be fought in either the public room or in an [[instance]]. It has two distinct stats if the player is fighting it in the public or an instanced room; the public variant of Scurrius is slightly stronger than the instanced version. [[Ironmen]] can participate with other accounts and will receive killcount, although they will not receive any drops except medium clues if they can manage to attain MVP. [[Group Ironman Mode|Group Ironmen]] have access to a shared instance allowing them to fight Scurrius together.

Scurrius rewards a substantially greater amount of combat experience than normal, especially with [[rat bone weapons]], giving competitive amounts of experience compared to [[Nightmare Zone]] and [[sand crab]]s, though high-levelled players will still be better off training combat through existing methods. 

Although the boss drops [[rat meat]], this meat cannot be cooked during the fight since players cannot light fires in its lair; attempting to do so produces the message, "It's far too damp for you to light a fire here."

[[Dwarf multicannon|Cannons]] cannot be set up in Scurrius's lair. Attempting to do so produces the message, "It's far too damp for you to set up a cannon in here."

Scurrius' lair is located within the [[Varrock Sewers]], with the sewers being accessible via a [[manhole]] just east of [[Varrock Palace]]. The lair can be found east of the sewers entrance.

Players can enter or leave the lair by climbing through the [[broken bars]] or by crossing through [[sewage water]], respectively; there will be an approximately 15 second delay after leaving before being able to rejoin.

==Fight overview==
{{Main|Scurrius/Strategies}}
Scurrius has three attacks: his melee attack with his tail, magic attack with blue lightning being discharged, and a ranged attack of stinky fur balls being thrown at players. The fight is split into three phases; Scurrius may heal from the [[Food Pile]]s between each phase. While he is eating, he has a slight damage reduction applied to him. Scurrius may also summon six [[Giant rat (Scurrius)|giant rat]]s to aid him during the fight.

==Drops (MVP/Solo)==
{{#subobject:MVP|Dummy property=true}}
''Players will only roll this table if they dealt the most damage to Scurrius. (E.g., if they are in a private instance.)''

==Trivia ==
* A {{WP|rat king}} is a collection of rats whose tails are intertwined and bound together in some way.
*The examine text refers to the myth that rats are always present in urban areas, even if the person doesn't see them.
* Scurrius was originally conceived as a concept from the [[April 2023 Game Jam#The_Rat_King_(Free-to-play_mechanics-based_boss)|April 2023 Game Jam]].
* Unlike most large monsters, Scurrius drops its loot on the centre of the 3x3 tiles it occupies, rather than its south-westernmost tile. [[Long bone]]s,  [[curved bone]]s, and [[Clue scroll (medium)|medium clues]] are dropped on the south-westernmost tile, however.
* It was hinted at during the 26 January 2024 Old School Live stream that one of the smaller rats is actually in control of Scurrius, presumably the mage head is in control of Scurrius itself.
