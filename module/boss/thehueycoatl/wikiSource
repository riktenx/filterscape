'''The Hueycoatl''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|hw|eɪ|k|oʊ|ˈ|æ|t|ə|l}} {{Respell|HWAY|koh|at|el}}{{CiteVideo|author=Old School RuneScape|title="We've Added A Dog With Fake Glasses and a Moustache" Varlamore Dev Diary|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u_RQHrcf0o&t=124s|timestamp=02:04|date=7 September 2024|site=YouTube}}) is a [[draconic]] [[boss]] whose large body is coiled around [[the Darkfrost]]. Said to have scales as strong as rock and asleep atop a pile of gold, the Hueycoatl has awakened and wreaked havoc around the mountain and the dwarves of [[Cam Torum]] require assistance in subduing her.{{CiteText|text=Tales of the Old Ones: The Hueycoatl|page=2|quote=There lives a great and terrible monster known as the Hueycoatl. She spends all day digging for gold with her mighty claws.}}

She can be fought in a group of up to 20 players, or via a private instance by the [[meeting flag]] next to the [[bank buffalo]] for a fee of 50,000 coins (25,000 with completion of the [[Combat Achievements/Hard|hard combat achievements]]). [[Ironman Mode|Ironmen]] are eligible for drops when fought in a group. Though players can solo her, there are parts of the fight that are preferably dealt with in a group.

Uniques from the boss include the [[tome of earth]], the [[dragon hunter wand]], [[Hueycoatl hide]], and [[huasca seed]]s, whose herbs are exclusively used to create [[prayer regeneration potion]]s.

==Fight overview==
{{Main|The Hueycoatl/Strategies}}
Players initially confront five exposed segments of the Hueycoatl's body at the base of the mountain, all the while avoiding the glowing symbols and using the correct prayers to counter her projectiles. Once all segments are defeated, the tail ascends the mountain, clearing the path to the summit.

At the summit, players must attack her head directly, again taking care to avoid glowing symbols and pray correctly. Here, teams of three or more can balance their protection prayers in order to allow the [[Seer (The Darkfrost)|seer]] to light up the braziers, activating a 30% damage bonus for players. This bonus remains in effect as long as the braziers are lit.

Once players get her to half health, she will shield herself, requiring players to break her tail. The tail is subject to a damage cap of 4 or 9, depending on whether the player's crush attack bonus is their highest, making this phase the longest of the fight for smaller teams. Additionally, the tail will perform a slam attack each time it shifts position, releasing a shockwave that inflicts approximately 25 damage if not evaded.

Once the tail's health is depleted, the Hueycoatl's shield dissipates, allowing players to resume their attack on her. In this final stage, she will continue her standard attacks (glowing symbols and prayer projectiles) with increased frequency, while also employing her tail slam shockwave attack.

==Money making==
{{Mmgsection|Killing Hueycoatl (Solo)|mobname=The Hueycoatl}}

==Drops== 
In order to obtain drops from the Hueycoatl, the player must deal a minimum of ~75 damage to the head or tail. If the player doesn't do at least ~25 damage to the body, they will receive fewer rewards. The Hueycoatl drops a large lump of items upon death, and the share players receive from it is based on the player's total damage to the Hueycoatl. 

The maximum quantity of a drop assumes that the player is soloing.

The MVP, the player who deals the most damage, gets a 10% increase to their drop share.
