'''The Leviathan''' is a large sea creature found within [[the Scar]], who is encountered during [[Desert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire]]. Once dwelling in the [[Eastern Sea]], the Leviathan was inadvertently dragged into the Scar during the [[Battle for the Eye]] when [[Perseriya]] accidentally opened an abyssal rift in an attempt to teleport reinforcements in.

It has since then adapted to the abyssal environment and has made itself at home in a large lake within the Scar, preying upon those who were unfortunate enough to be pulled into the Scar during the battle. This is seen clearly on accounts of survivors and what remains of the Zarosian fleet in the area.

It is replaced by a stronger variant after completion of the quest which the player can repeatedly fight.

[[The Scar]] is an area of the [[Abyssal Space]], accessed by talking to the [[Catalytic Guardian]] in the [[Temple of the Eye (location)|Temple of the Eye]]. To reach the Leviathan in the Scar, players must proceed east of the [[Abyssal Rift (The Scar)|Abyssal Rift]] towards [[Wizard Persten]]'s camp. A rowboat there can then be used to reach the island where the Leviathan is located. Climbing the [[Handholds (The Leviathan)|handholds]] onto the platform initiates the fight momentarily.

A [[Scoreboard (The Leviathan)|scoreboard]] just before the rowboat shows statistics related to the Leviathan.

==Fight overview==
{{Main|The Leviathan/Strategies}}
The Leviathan is best fought with [[ranged]]; attempting to attack The Leviathan with [[melee]] will result in the following message: {{mes|Your melee attacks can't reach the lure!}} The boss fight is initiated upon climbing into the arena, where it will use a volley of rapid-firing attacks which deal damage upon impact; protection prayers will fully block these attacks.
[[File:Fighting the Leviathan.png|thumb|left|250px|A player fighting the Leviathan.]]
The Leviathan will attack with random volleys of coloured orbs - magic (blue), ranged (green), and melee (orange) - at varying attack speeds throughout the fight. At the end of each volley, the boss will roar and cause debris to fall onto the player, potentially restricting movement and obstructing line of sight. Every subsequent volley of attacks will increase in attack speed, which can become very difficult to switch prayers for players at later volleys. The boss can also bite players in the tiles right next to the pool, which deals melee damage.

At any point during the sequence, players can cast [[shadow spells]] to stun the Leviathan (which will always succeed), where it will stay still for 15 [[ticks]] (9 seconds). Damage against it is capped at 10 when stunned, but the player can run around to attack its backside to deal a large amount of damage, which will cause it to retaliate with a special attack. This also resets the Leviathan's attack speed to the beginning of the 2-tick attacks.

Upon reaching 180 hitpoints, the Leviathan will begin the enrage phase. Its attack speed will now stay at two ticks, losing the ability to launch orange melee orbs (but still being able to bite players) while an [[abyssal pathfinder]] will spawn to the north-west of the arena (or the next clockwise direction if the spawn point is blocked by debris) and will begin to move clockwise. The player must stay within the pathfinder's area-of-effect in order to gain increased accuracy and damage, along with full protection from its attacks; otherwise, its attacks will pierce through prayer.

==Awakened version==
The Leviathan can also be '''awakened''' by use of an [[Awakener's orb]], greatly increasing the boss' stats and increasing the difficulty of the mechanics for a much harder fight.
For an overview of the differences between the regular and awakened versions of the boss, see this [[The Leviathan/Strategies#Awakened mode|strategy guide]].

===Mechanics===
When the Leviathan is defeated, a drop will be rolled for until the roll results in a success, as described below:{{CiteNews|url=https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/desert-treasure-ii---tweaks-and-drop-rates?oldschool=1|title=Desert Treasure II - Tweaks and Drop Rates|newsdate=3 August 2023}}
* Roll 1/96 for the tradeable unique drop table (3/96 for awakened variant).
** If unsuccessful, roll 1/53 for the [[awakener's orb]].
** If unsuccessful, roll 1/25 for [[scarred tablet]].
** If unsuccessful, roll 1/200 for [[smoke quartz]].
** If unsuccessful, roll 1/5 for the supply drop table.
* If all rolls above were unsuccessful, the standard drop table is rolled.
* Once the player rolls the entire drop table, roll 1/2,500 for [[Lil'viathan]] and 1/40 for a clue scroll.

In addition, defeating the boss perfectly will earn 50% more loot from the standard drop table.{{CiteReddit|author=Mod Ayiza|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/15gzjui/desert_treasure_ii_tweaks_and_drop_rates/julpslb/|date=3 August 2023|archiveurl=https://archive.li/lVplt|archivedate=3 August 2023|quote=You have to do the fight while avoiding any avoidable damage. Essentially a perfect fight (chip damage does not count).|title=Desert Treasure II - Tweaks and Drop Rates}} This requires the player to kill the Leviathan without taking any avoidable damage, which includes:
* Standard rapid-fire volleys
* Getting hit by falling debris
* Bite damage
* Lightning Barrage damage
* Smoke Blast damage
* In the awakened fight, getting hit by the tornado

==Trivia==
*The {{wp|Leviathan}} is a mythical creature referenced extensively in the Bible and is associated with the sin of envy.
*Its design appears to be based on a {{RSL|Raw rocktail|rocktail}}, a cave-dwelling fish from ''RuneScape'', both the {{RSL|Raw rocktail|raw}} and {{RSL|Rocktail|cooked}} version.
*The Leviathan is the only Desert Treasure 2 boss which is aggressive towards players upon spawning:
**[[Duke Sucellus]] is in a sleeping state and is not aggressive until awakened with poison.
**[[Vardorvis]] does not attack players when entering his arena nor when he respawns, since his barrier mechanic does not trigger until he is attacked.
**[[The Whisperer]], while as an Odd Figure, does focus on the player, but she cannot attack in that state and is a separate NPC.

* The Leviathan is the only Desert Treasure 2 boss to not have a lore reason for returning back to life after every kill:
** Duke Sucellus is not killed by the player, merely subdued after which he falls back asleep.
** Vardorvis' body is reanimated by [[the Strangler]].
** The Whisperer is reanimated by the power of [[Ancient Pillar (Desert Treasure II)|the Ancient Pillar]].

* The Leviathan is the only Desert Treasure 2 Boss to not be a member of [[Zarosian Empire|the Zarosian Empire]].
* While this Leviathan had adapted to the abyss, a leviathan in its natural state is a [[rsw:Crassian_Leviathan|boss]] in ''RuneScape.''

* The Leviathan may be inspired by a similar fight in the Drakengard series.
* Unlike most monsters, the Leviathan's normal mode encounter provides more slayer experience than its health suggests. This is not the case with its Awakened variant.
