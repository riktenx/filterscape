[[File:Smoke devil icon.png|left]]
The '''thermonuclear smoke devil''', often referred to as '''thermy''', is the boss version of the [[smoke devil]]. It requires a minimum of 93 [[Slayer]] to damage. Located at the [[Smoke Devil Dungeon]] south of [[Castle Wars]], the Thermonuclear smoke devil can only be attacked on a smoke devil task, with the exception of one kill for the [[Western Provinces Diary]] (provided that the player has 93 Slayer without boosting).

It is the only monster to drop the [[smoke battlestaff]], [[jar of smoke]] and the [[pet smoke devil]]. It drops the [[occult necklace]] at a higher rate than [[smoke devil]]s do.

Unlike most NPCs, the Thermonuclear smoke devil is always able to walk through other monsters/players. This is to prevent players from safespotting the boss using the smoke devils found in its lair.

A [[dwarf multicannon]] cannot be used inside the boss room. If it is set up, the cannon will be destroyed (as in the lairs of the [[King Black Dragon|KBD]] and [[Kalphite Queen|KQ]]).

==Location==
There are several ways to access the dungeon:
*The [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|BKP}} will bring the players just south-west of the dungeon.
*Using a [[ring of dueling]] to teleport to [[Castle Wars]], then running south-west.

==Trivia==
[[File:Snowman ring (Thermy) equipped.png|thumb|upright|A player transformed into a Thermy snowman.]]
* The thermonuclear smoke devil was graphically updated on [[27 September]] [[2018]] as part of an [[Update:Decanting, Withdraw X, and Bucket Packs|update]]. Prior to the update, it was simply a larger version of the smoke devils scattered across the dungeon.
* The thermonuclear smoke devil and the [[Kraken]] are the only slayer bosses that can be fought with another player.
* Attempting to attack the thermonuclear smoke devil with a [[stat boost|boosted]] Slayer level of at least 93 will yield the message: {{mes|Although Brieve will allow you to kill this boss off-task for the Achievement Diary, the level 93 requirement still applies. Stat-boosts are not accepted.}}
* Players can transform into a Thermy snowman by using a [[snowman ring]], which resembles the thermonuclear smoke devil.
* The thermonuclear smoke devil has an eye and not a mouth, as confirmed in a [[Postbag from the Hedge]] letter <ref>{{PlainCiteNews|url=https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a=97/gielinor-gazette---may-2022?oldschool=1|title=Gielinor Gazette - May 2022|newsdate=31 May 2022}}</ref>
* If the thermonuclear smoke devil is your most-killed boss, the Combat Achievements summary page will list it as "Thermy".
