Carnifex Maximus '''Vardorvis''' was a [[vampyre]] whose corpse is found in [[the Stranglewood]] Ritual Site, animated by [[the Strangler]] parasite. A high-ranking member of the [[Zarosian Empire]], Vardorvis succumbed to the Strangler and has remained under its control ever since, where the player encounters it during [[Desert Treasure II - The Fallen Empire]]. A stronger variant of him can be fought again after the completion of the quest.

[[The Stranglewood]]'s Ritual Site is located north-west of the forest. The site can be accessed by climbing over [[rocks (Vardorvis)|rocks]] leading to it. After entering the Ritual Site once, a shortcut on the pathway north-west of the temple can be used to reach Vardorvis quicker.

An [[Ancient Tablet (Vardorvis)|ancient tablet]] by the rocks leading to the Ritual Site shows statistics related to Vardorvis.

==History==
[[File:Statue (Vardorvis).png|thumb|left|180px|The statue of Carnifex Maximus Vardorvis in the Ancient Vault.]]
Vardorvis was a [[vampyre]] who served the [[Zarosian Empire]] under the rank of Carnifex Maximus, whose role was that of an executioner or headsman.{{CiteNPC|npc=Ghost (Ruins of Camdozaal)|quote=Useless! Perhaps the headsman needs to take your head as well.}} He was one of four individuals entrusted with a medallion - the means to open the [[Ancient Vault]] where the [[Elder Horn]] was sealed - alongside [[Perseriya]], [[Duke Sucellus]], and [[the Whisperer]], who were all high-ranking personnel in the Empire.

At some point during the [[Third Age]], after the [[Betrayal of Zaros]], he was deployed to [[Lassar]] to defend the fortress from a siege by [[Saradomin]]ists. This included the [[Imcando dwarves]], who pledged their allegiance to Saradomin in exchange for a new settlement after their previous home, [[Imcandoria]], was destroyed.{{CiteNPC|npc=Ghost (Ruins of Camdozaal)|quote=The city [Imcandoria] fell and now they are homeless.}}{{CiteNPC|npc=Ghost (Ruins of Camdozaal)|quote=It seems [the Imcando] have been promised a new home here in return for wiping us out.}} Once the Zarosian forces were driven out, the Imcando dwarves set to build their new city, naming it [[Camdozaal]].

During the siege, [[Yonrith Lovakengj]], the opposing army leader, fled westward with his closest allies and settled in modern-day [[Lovakengj]], which Yonrith founded. However, believed to be wounded by pride (as Yonrith was the first to escape him{{CiteText|text=Tatty page|quote=He claims the target to be a danger to the Empire who cannot be allowed to live, but it's hard to ignore the role the Carnifex Maximus' pride may be playing. After all, this is the first time anyone has escaped his axe.}}), Vardorvis brought a small force to pursue him all the way to the western continent,{{CiteNPC|npc=Ghost (Ruins of Camdozaal)|quote=Their leader is named Yonrith Lovakengj. He has fled to the west with his closest allies, but much of his army still remains. Carnifex Maximus Vardorvis is in pursuit of him.}} and made camp in what is now known as [[the Stranglewood]].

On the sixth day of their pursuit, Vardorvis' venators successfully located the Imcando dwarves.{{CiteText|text=Tatty page|quote=The timing couldn't be worse, for the venators have also located the dwarves.}} However, one of Vardorvis' subordinates, interested in studying [[the Strangler]], accidentally infected him with a sample of the parasite on the same day.{{CiteText|text=Tatty page|quote=It seems my eagerness may have come at a cost. The sample I collected from the ritual site was carrying some sort of parasite, and of course, it was the Carnifex Maximus himself who ended up getting infected.}} As a result, Vardorvis lost his vampyric immunity and was [[Vardorvis' Head|beheaded]] by the Imcando dwarves,{{CiteText|text=Tatty page|quote=They took his head clean off! He's a vampyre! It shouldn't have been possible, but they did it all the same! The parasite must be to blame.}} who attacked their camp the next day.{{CiteText|text=Tatty page|quote=They attacked! The dwarves must have tracked the venators, for they found our camp with ease. Most of our party is dead or injured...}} The plague proceeded to move his body and axe to the ritual site, where he would remain for thousands of years.{{CiteText|text=Tatty page|quote=The parasite must be to blame. It's far more dangerous than we thought, and I fear others may be infected as well. Many have claimed to be feeling strangely unwell, and one of the legionaries even started having visions. Of all things, he thought he saw the Carnifex Maximus' body move!}}

During the [[Fifth Age]], an adventurer who sought his medallion eventually found Vardorvis in the Stranglewood, though the medallion was not on him; rather, it had been taken by a disguised [[Sliske]] (as [[Kasonde]]). The adventurer killed Vardorvis, though the plague reanimated him after their departure.

==Fight overview==
{{Main|Vardorvis/Strategies}}
Vardorvis uses a standard melee attack, which is reduced by roughly ~75% when [[Protect from Melee]] is active; regardless, he will heal for 50% of the damage inflicted, rounded down. Unlike the other members of the Forgotten Four, who use their special attacks in a rather slow and predictable manner, Vardorvis uses them at random, which can make parts of the fight more hectic.

[[File:Fighting Vardorvis.png|left|thumb|A player fighting Vardorvis.]]
In addition, Vardorvis' Strength and Defence levels scales linearly with his remaining hitpoints; as his health falls, his Defence level is lowered while his Strength level is increased, increasing the potency of his auto-attacks though making him easier to hit.<ref>[https://imgur.com/a/ppJmNOl https://imgur.com/a/ppJmNOl]</ref> Vardorvis' mechanics are adjusted accordingly as his health lowers.

Vardorvis uses the following special attacks:
* '''Swinging Axes''': The Strangler's vines will swing up to three axes within the arena. Getting hit with this attack will deal up to 35 damage, and incur a damage-over-time "bleed" effect in which the player takes 3 bleed damage 5 times (more than 5 times if the player moves while bleeding). The bleed will persist even through teleportation. Using [[Protect from Melee]] will reduce the axes' initial hit by 50%, but will not reduce damage from the bleed.
* '''Strangle''': Vardorvis will strike his arm into the ground and entangle the player in tendrils. Several spores will appear at the centre of the game screen, and the player must destroy them all within five seconds, otherwise the tendrils will tighten and deal high damage.
* '''Head Gaze''': The Strangler's vines will use [[Vardorvis' Head]] to launch a single green projectile. If this projectile is not blocked with [[Protect from Missiles]], it will disable overhead protection prayers and drain the player's prayer points by 10. The head's attack always attack off-tick with the body, but failing to protect against it will leave the player vulnerable to nearby axes and the body.
* '''Darting Spikes''': Vardorvis will dart around the player, causing cracks to appear. Vines will then erupt from them, dealing up to 25 damage if caught in one and healing him for half the amount. One crack will always appear underneath the player (if not standing by the edges), and more will appear if not standing around the edges.

Upon reaching 33% of his health, Vardrovis will enter an enrage phase, significantly increasing the frequency of his special attacks.

==Drops==
{{DropLogProject|kills=5036647}}

===Average value===
Drop values are listed by whether you include the [[Ultor Ring]] and [[Soulreaper Axe]] components, which must be completed to be sold, as well as if your kill was credited as perfect.
{{BossValue/Vardorvis}}

===Mechanics===
When Vardorvis is defeated, a drop will be rolled for until the roll results in a success, as described below:{{CiteNews|url=https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/desert-treasure-ii---tweaks-and-drop-rates?oldschool=1|title=Desert Treasure II - Tweaks and Drop Rates|newsdate=3 August 2023}}
* Roll 1/136 for the tradeable unique drop table (3/136 for awakened variant).
** If unsuccessful, roll 1/80 for the [[awakener's orb]].
** If unsuccessful, roll 1/25 for [[strangled tablet]].
** If unsuccessful, roll 1/200 for [[blood quartz]].
** If unsuccessful, roll 1/5 for the supply drop table.
* If all rolls above were unsuccessful, the standard drop table is rolled.
* Once the player rolls the entire drop table, roll 1/3,000 for [[Butch]] and 1/40 for a clue scroll.

In addition, defeating the boss perfectly will earn 50% more loot from the standard drop table.{{CiteReddit|author=Mod Ayiza|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/15gzjui/desert_treasure_ii_tweaks_and_drop_rates/julpslb/|date=3 August 2023|archiveurl=https://archive.li/lVplt|archivedate=3 August 2023|quote=You have to do the fight while avoiding any avoidable damage. Essentially a perfect fight (chip damage does not count).|title=Desert Treasure II - Tweaks and Drop Rates}} This requires the player to kill Vardorvis without taking any avoidable damage, which includes:
* Damage from a melee attack off-prayer
* Damage from all special attacks

==Trivia==
* Carnifex Maximus is Latin and translates to "supreme butcher". In ancient roman society, a Carnifex was a professional torturer and executioner, often acting upon slaves and common criminals.
* Vardorvis' title of Carnifex Maximus is similar to those that [[Zamorak]] and [[Azzanadra]] had in ''RuneScape'', when they both were in the service of Zaros.
* Upon entering the arena, a [[Large Tendril]] can be seen picking up Vardorvis' axe from outside the central arena.
* When asking a [[Slayer Master]] for [[Slayer task tips|tips]] on killing Vardorvis, they describe him as an undead vampyre. Despite this, Vardorvis is neither weak to [[Silver weaponry]], nor is he affected by [[Crumble Undead]] or the [[Salve amulet]].
* Similarly to the [[Alchemical Hydra]], Vardorvis is visible in the overworld, but is fought in an instance. He is the only one of [[The Forgotten Four]] who can be seen outside of their instance.
