'''Venenatis''' is a large spider that resides in the [[Silk Chasm]], at level 35 [[Wilderness]].

According to [[Phabelle Bile]], Venenatis is the last of her kind, who were hunted to extinction by dwarves. 

A [[dwarf multicannon]] cannot be set up in the Silk Chasm; if attempted, you will receive the message: ''It doesn't seem safe to set up a cannon here.''

[[Ironman_Mode|Ironmen]] are eligible for drops from Venenatis when defeating it alongside other players.

==Strategy==
{{Main|Venenatis/Strategies}}
Venenatis attacks with [[melee]] towards any player that's adjacent to her, and either [[magic]] or [[ranged]] for any player out of her melee range. Protection prayers will fully block the attacks, however, they will have their effectiveness reduced for every [[Venenatis' Spiderling (monster)|spiderling]] alive in the chamber.

Every four attacks, Venenatis will shuffle to another position in her lair. Every two movements will cause her to alternate between ranged and magic attacks.

When a kill starts, Venenatis begins by summoning two spiderlings, who also increase her max hit along with reducing prayer effectiveness. The spiderlings will drain prayer by 1 for every hit made regardless if it damages or not, however they only have 5 health and players will deal their max hit on them regardless of gear. Venenatis can also launch a sticky web that if stood on, damages and drains prayer by 3 and run energy by 10 every few ticks. Venenatis will always alternate between the spiderlings and the sticky web after moving around twice.

If 5 or more players are in Venenatis' lair, she will move more often and perform a special attack every time she moves, as opposed to every other time.

==Drops==
{{DropLogProject|kills=60120}}

The listed quantities are for soloing Venenatis. In group encounters, Venenatis's drops, including uniques, will be split proportionally based on damage done. Up to 10 players may obtain drops per kill in this manner, and each of the top 10 players will receive at least 25% of the solo loot quantity.

==Historical==
From her release to [[25 January]] [[2023]], Venenatis could be found roaming just north of the [[green dragon]]s on the eastern shore of the Wilderness and was the only one of the bosses she was released with to be below level 30 Wilderness. She only attacked with melee and magic and had two mechanics; a prayer drain on her target and could also launch sticky webs at them that could deal up to 60 damage and briefly stun them. Venenatis also had a unique damage reduction mechanic in part that she would only take 1-6 damage from any hit if she was in a single-way area, as the area was partially multi and single combat zones.

==Trivia==
* Venenatis' 2014 model was a recoloured version of [[Kalrag]].
* She was a player-suggested [[boss]], which was adopted into the game after a substantial amount of positive forum feedback.
* The term Venenatis comes from the Latin "[[wiktionary:venenatis|venēnātīs]]", which means "venomous" or "poisoned".
* Despite her name's origin and Phabelle Bile mentioning Venenatis does indeed produce venom, she and her spiderlings are not [[venom|venomous]] or [[poisonous]] to players. This is leftover from before the Wilderness boss rework, when her attacks inflicted poison.
* If someone starts a battle with Venenatis, but leaves the cave without killing her, she will de-spawn after 10 minutes.
