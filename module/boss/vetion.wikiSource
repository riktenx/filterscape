'''Vet'ion''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|'|v|E|t|i:|@|n}} {{respell|VET|ee|É™n}}) is a Zamorakian [[Skeleton|skeletal]] champion that resides in [[Vet'ion's Rest]], at level 35 [[Wilderness]]. Like other bosses in the Wilderness, he can also drop the [[dragon pickaxe]].

Vet'ion has two forms: the (purple) regular form and the (orange) enraged form. After he is defeated in his first form, he will go to his second form, which has a faster attack speed and stronger max hit. After changing forms he will reset any stat reductions applied in the first form. If he is not killed within five minutes in his second form, he will revert to his first form with the same [[hit points]]. If he reverts after his hellhounds have been killed, the player(s) will not have to kill them a second time.

According to [[Andros Mai]], Vet'ion's power comes from his resting place.

[[Ironman_Mode|Ironmen]] are eligible for drops from Vet'ion when defeating it alongside other players.

==Fight overview==
{{Main|Vet'ion/Strategies}}
Vet'ion is highly resistant to any combat style other than [[crush]], and as he is [[undead]], he is susceptible to [[Salve amulet]] and its [[Salve amulet (e)|enhanced]] version.

Vet'ion primarily attacks with targeted magic, launching lightning in a 3x3 radius around each player upon attacking. While he appears to swing his sword during these animations, they do not deal any melee damage. Indirect hits will deal less damage than a direct hit. Occasionally, he may prepare for a shield bash if players are near him, targeting an area in front of him. Players caught in the targeted area (or standing underneath him) when he bashes his shield will take damage and be rendered unable to attack for a few seconds.

Vet'ion is fought similarly to the [[Kalphite Queen]] in that he has two forms, a "normal" and "enraged" form. When he reaches half health in his first form for the first time, he summons two level 194 [[Skeleton Hellhound (Vet'ion)|Skeleton Hellhound]]s that attack with powerful melee, and must be killed as they grant him complete damage immunity while alive. Upon being forced into his next stage, Vet'ion will become enraged and unleash a blast of energy around him, working the same as the targeted magic attack. In this form, he will attack faster, his attacks will deal more damage, and any drained Defence levels will be restored. In the second form, he summons two level 231 [[Greater Skeleton Hellhound (Vet'ion)|Greater Skeleton Hellhound]]s that are even stronger (although still sharing the same health) and must also be killed.

Like the Kalphite Queen, if players don't kill his second form within 5 minutes, he'll revert to his normal state.

==Drops==
{{DropLogProject|kills=43776}}

The listed quantities are for soloing Vet'ion. In group encounters, Vet'ion's drops, including uniques, will be split proportionally based on damage done. Up to 10 players may obtain drops per kill in this manner, and each of the top 10 players will receive at least 25% of the solo loot quantity.

==Historical==
Unlike the other two bosses Vet'ion was released with, [[Callisto]] and [[Venenatis]], Vet'ion did not get any adjustments to his stats following his rework on [[25 January]] [[2023]]. However, the fight in general was made vastly different as he was considered the hardest to kill due to his mechanics:

* Vet'ion could attack with both melee and magic. The magic attack was a targeted attack that threw three orbs of lightning, one on the player's tile and another two elsewhere that could not be reduced with [[Protect from Magic]].
* Periodically, Vet'ion could also slam his khopesh into the ground as a shockwave attack, dealing up to 45 typeless damage to any player within 6-7 tiles of him.
* In addition to both of his forms having 255 hitpoints, the skeleton hellhound and the greater variant he summoned in pairs had 110 and 190 hitpoints, respectively. This effectively brought the amount of damage required to kill Vet'ion to 1,110, over four times as much as Callisto or Venenatis who both only had 255 hitpoints prior to their reworks.

==Trivia==
* Vet'ion's 2014 model was an enlarged, re-coloured version of [[Ranalph Devere]] from the [[Legends' Quest]].
* Vet'ion's examine is a reference to Tolkien's ''{{WP|The Return of the King}}''.
* Vet'ion's name is an anagram of {{RSL|Novite equipment|Novite}} from ''RuneScape''.
** Vet'ion's armour in his normal form matches the colour of Novite armour (tier 1) and the recolour in his enraged form matches {{RSL|Primal equipment|Primal armour}} (tier 99), both found within {{RSL|Daemonheim}} (located in the Wilderness).
