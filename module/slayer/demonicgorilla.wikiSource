'''Demonic gorillas''' are powerful creatures found in the [[Crash Site Cavern]]. Two of them are fought during [[Monkey Madness II]], in the penultimate stage of the fight. After the quest is completed, more demonic gorillas can be found in the caverns alongside their [[Tortured gorilla|tortured]] brethren. They are primarily killed for their [[zenyte shard]] and [[ballista]] component drops.

Demonic gorillas count as [[monkey]]s and [[black demons]] for the progression of [[Slayer task]]s. As they are demons, they are susceptible to the effects of [[demonbane weapons]], excluding [[holy water]]. Demonic gorillas '''cannot''' be damaged with a [[Dwarf multicannon]].

Players can check their kill count by reading [[Gravestone (Tree Gnome Stronghold)|Nieve's gravestone]] next to [[Lumo]] at the opening in the fence.

==Fight overview==
{{main|Demonic gorilla/Strategies}}
Demonic gorillas use all three [[combat style]]s to attack. They will change combat styles after missing three hits in that attack style. They are also capable of using [[protection prayers]] and will switch to the player's last used combat style against them when they have taken 70 or more damage. Therefore, players must bring at least two different combat styles to kill them. As they have a very high magic level, they are most often killed with melee and ranged.

The gorillas also have a special attack where they send a rock crashing down at the player's position, which can be easily avoided by moving one tile away from the current spot when the attack was initiated. If struck by this rock, the player will take 33% of their current health as damage; it cannot kill the player by itself as a result. (Warning! The player can be hit by other players rocks.)

Note that the gorilla's prayers '''cannot''' be bypassed through the use of [[Verac the Defiled's equipment|Verac's set]] or [[special attacks]]. However, the healing effects of equipment like [[Guthan the Infested's equipment]] or [[Saradomin Godsword]] will still take place even through prayer.

==Trivia==
*Demonic gorillas are similar to the [[tormented demons]]; both use all three forms of [[combat]], [[protection prayers]] and drop items that are used to create more powerful equipment.
*Demonic gorillas' prayers were slightly changed several days after release due to several glitches happening with specific weapons, notably the [[Saradomin godsword]].
