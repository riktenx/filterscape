'''Gargoyles''' are [[Slayer monsters]] located in the [[Slayer Tower]]'s top floor and basement, requiring 75 [[Slayer]] in order to be harmed. Those found in the basement are only available to players who are assigned gargoyles as their [[Slayer task]]. If they attempt to kill them off-task, [[Raulyn]] will prevent them from attacking.

Gargoyles, like [[rockslug]]s, cannot be killed normally. In order to kill a gargoyle, a [[rock hammer]], a [[rock thrownhammer]], or a [[granite hammer]] must be used when they reach 8 or lower [[Hitpoints]]. Normally, the item must be used on the gargoyle, but players can buy the "[[Gargoyle smasher|Gargoyle Smasher]]" perk from [[Slayer Master]]s for 120 [[Slayer points]], which will automatically smash the gargoyle when it falls to 9 or lower Hitpoints, provided that the player has a rock hammer (or equivalent) in their inventory. The [[granite hammer]] will automatically smash gargoyles even without the perk if it is equipped.

Because of the number of [[rune item]] drops, it is recommended to bring [[High Level Alchemy]] runes to reduce the frequency of banking and save inventory space.

Gargoyles can be [[safespotted]] near the doorway in the south-west area at the top floor in Slayer Tower or in the north-east corner of the basement behind an immovable bucket on the floor.

It should be noted that the gargoyles on the top floor of the tower are located after [[aberrant spectre]]s, who drain players' stats if they are not wearing a [[Slayer helmet]] or [[nose peg]]. They may be avoided by using the Agility shortcut in the north-east from {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} to {{FloorNumber|uk=2}}, although this route takes longer. These gargoyles are susceptible to [[poison]] and [[venom]]; the basement ones are immune to both.

In the book [[The living statues]], it's revealed that the gargoyles were animated by the [[Bandosian]] general [[Snaarldor]] with the [[black tourmaline core]], but turned against them after they ordered the gargoyles to fight against the forces of [[Zamorak]]. This was due to the Slayer Tower being filled with Zamorakian magic, as the creator of the tower, [[Viggora]], was a Zamorakian.

Being a [[Golem (attribute)|golem]], this creature is affected by [[golembane weapons]].
