[[File:Nechryael icon.png|left]]
'''Nechryael''' are demonic [[Slayer creature]]s, which require a [[Slayer]] level of 80 in order to harm. They are found in the [[Slayer Tower]], and their stronger variant, [[Greater nechryael]], can be found in the [[Catacombs of Kourend]],  [[Iorwerth Dungeon]], and the [[Wilderness Slayer Cave]]. Nechryael are known for their [[rune boots]] drop, which are one of the few boots to provide a [[Strength#Strength bonus|Strength bonus]] when worn. They are also known for their frequent drop rates of [[seeds]] and combat [[runes]], consider bringing a [[Seed box]] due to the large amount of seed drops.

Commonly, nechryael summon [[death spawn]]s to aid them, up to a limit of two each per nechryael. Death spawns have semi-inaccurate attacks with a max hit of 2, and their attacks can hit through [[Protect from Melee]]. [[Auto-retaliate]] does not work on them, so you will have to click the death spawn to attack it. Death spawns will not be summoned if the nechryael is unable to attack the player back (such as when being [[safespotted]]). The [[Death spawn|death spawns]] will stop attacking any player who moves more than 7 tiles away from them, which is useful when fighting the more powerful [[nechryarch]].

[[Arclight]] can be very effective against nechryael, as they are considered to be demonic creatures. Their stronger variant, [[greater nechryael]], are more commonly killed with [[Ice Burst]] or [[Ice Barrage]] in the [[Catacombs of Kourend]].

Nechryaels located in the [[Slayer Tower]] Basement can only be attacked whilst on a Slayer task.

== Safespotting ==
In the [[Slayer Tower]] there are many tables and buckets, which can easily be used to safespot Nechryael. Safespotting Nechryael prevents them from summoning death spawns and makes the task very easy.
