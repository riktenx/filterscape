'''Skeletal wyverns''' are [[Slayer monsters]] that require a [[Slayer]] level of 72 in order to be harmed. They are found at the end of the [[Asgarnian Ice Dungeon]]. There is a shortcut at the ladder to the Ice Dungeon leading to the skeletal wyverns requiring level 82 [[Agility]] (or level 77 Agility with a [[Summer pie]]). Like other [[wyverns]], they require an [[elemental shield]], [[mind shield]], [[dragonfire shield]], [[dragonfire ward]], or [[ancient wyvern shield]] to reduce damage from their [[Dragonfire#Icy breath|icy breath]]; however, it is not required to be slain. They are also the only monster that drop [[granite legs]].

Although it is insinuated in [[Tarn's diary]] that skeletal wyverns are [[undead]], they are in fact re-animated remains, whereas actual undead creatures have come back to life. This means that the [[Salve amulet]] and its enchanted versions do '''not''' work against them.

Skeletal wyverns are assigned by the [[Slayer master]]s [[Chaeldar]], [[Konar]], [[Nieve]], and [[Duradel|Duradel/Kuradal]]. Because an elemental shield or better is required to defend against their icy breath, they will '''only''' assign them if the player has completed the [[Elemental Workshop I]] [[quest]].{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1039948185337257989|date=12 September 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/CBLKu|archivedate=26 May 2020|quote=No, wyverns are not assigned unless one's done that quest.}}

Unlike the wyverns that reside within [[Fossil Island]], skeletal wyverns do '''not''' drop the [[wyvern visage]]; rather, they drop the [[draconic visage]].

There is a task-only area accessible via some icy steps by the exit to the wyvern area.

==Combat==
{{main|Skeletal Wyvern/Strategies}}
Skeletal wyverns have high [[Defence]], [[Attack]], and [[Hitpoints]], thus making them very challenging opponents. They attack with [[melee]], [[Ranged]], or their unique ice-breath attack. This attack can freeze players similar to the [[Ancient Magicks]]' [[ice spells]], with the addition of preventing the player from retaliating back for the duration of the freeze. However, players may still eat food or drink potions while frozen. Players can wield an [[Ancient wyvern shield|ancient]], [[mind shield|mind]], [[elemental shield|elemental]], or [[dragonfire shield]]/[[Dragonfire ward|ward]] to reduce the wyverns' ice breath's max hit to 10. The [[ancient wyvern shield]] also makes the player immune to the freezing effect of the icy breath. [[Armour]] does not affect the accuracy of the ice-breath attack; the ice-breath will hit through all types of armour.

[[Protect from Missiles]] is the suggested [[Prayer]] to use against them due to the amount of range damage skeletal wyverns do, although it is not needed if you can [[safespot]] them.

As the wyverns are [[draconic creatures]], [[dragonbane weapons]] such as the [[dragon hunter lance]] (on the pound/swipe stance, as wyverns' stab Defence is rather high) and the [[dragon hunter crossbow]] are the best choices to kill them swiftly. They are one of the only monsters in the game vulnerable to both dragonbane weapons and dragonfire effects. A dragon hunter crossbow with enchanted dragonstone bolts can be extremely effective against them.
Due to their moderate melee Defence, melee is recommended to kill wyverns, unless the player's [[Defence]] level is low. If killing wyverns with melee, an [[abyssal whip]] or other high-accuracy [[slash]] weapon is recommended. Wyverns are slightly weak to [[Magic]].

[[File:Skeletal Wyvern door safespot.png|thumb|300px|The most popular way of [[safespot]]ting Wyverns is done by trapping the eastern or western one on the side of the cave entrance after losing [[aggression]], as shown.]]
[[File:Skeletal Wyvern (upper level) safespot.png|thumb|297x297px|Safespot for task-only area.]]
Wyverns can be [[safespot]]ted in multiple ways. A common method for doing this is getting them stuck behind the main entrance. Players should always wait for the wyverns to become [[unaggressive]], which takes 10 minutes, before attempting this; otherwise, they'll get hit by other wyverns when trying to safespot another. A good method to make them unaggressive is to wait in front of the main entrance for ten minutes; this will make the wyverns unaggressive near the entrance. Players who do this should be careful not to walk more than a few steps deeper into the cave, as if they do, the wyverns will get [[aggressive]] again. Alternatively, for safespotting, players can bring a few [[Prayer potion]]s and attack the wyvern from seven steps away with [[Protect from Range|Protect from Missiles]] on.
